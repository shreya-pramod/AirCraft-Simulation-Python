# AirCraft-Simulation-Python
Implementation of an Aircraft simulation using python. The passenger boarding, deboarding and take off status is displayed.

Given a text file of passenger information, aircraft boarding and deboarding takes place. There are different priority zones allotted as per the user details. This
is taken care of using stack and queue implementation on python. Once the passengers are boarded, the flight takes off and the deboarding process occurs, the next set of 
passengers start to board the plane. The process repeats until all the passengers have reached their destination.
